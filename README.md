# RL-summer-school
This repo collects my notes and work whilst engaging in a summer school on the topic of Reinforcement Learning X Chemical engineering, taught by Daniel Cristiu and Dr Del Rio Chanona.

Inside each problem folder you will find:
1/problem description (rough notes);
2/my personal attempt on the problem;
3/the yml file that can be used to reproduce my working environment

To use a yml file, you can do the following:
1/download the yml file;
2/open anaconda prompt;
3/conda env create -f example.yml -n newenvname

replace example.yml with the actual yml file name, and newenvname with your desired name for the environment
